# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the blockchain-based land registry system.

## Smart Contract Security

### Audit Requirements
- All smart contracts must undergo a formal security audit before deployment to mainnet
- Use established security patterns and avoid complex logic that could introduce vulnerabilities
- Implement proper access controls for administrative functions

### Known Risks
- Clarity is a relatively new language, so be cautious of emerging security patterns
- Ensure proper validation of all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior
- Consider the immutability of blockchain data when designing contract logic

## Backend Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Store sensitive credentials in environment variables, never in code
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

### Data Protection
- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## Frontend Security

### User Authentication
- Implement secure login procedures with 2FA where possible
- Store tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies or secure local storage patterns
- Automatically log out inactive users

### Data Handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data displayed to users to prevent XSS attacks
- Use CSRF tokens for form submissions

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment
- Use container security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement least privilege principle for all services
- Keep all dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use secure configurations for all services (MongoDB, Node.js, etc.)

### Monitoring
- Implement logging for all security-relevant events
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regularly review access logs

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- Develop an incident response plan
- Identify key stakeholders and their responsibilities
- Document procedures for common security incidents

### Recovery
- Implement backup and restore procedures
- Have a plan for smart contract upgrades in case of vulnerabilities
- Establish communication channels for security announcements

## Regular Security Reviews

- Conduct periodic security assessments
- Stay updated on security best practices for all used technologies
- Encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities
